# The RNASEQ Toolkit 

![Rust](https://github.com/josephrhobbs/rnaseq/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

A highly efficient, open-source software tool for next-generation RNA sequencing.

__WIP Notice__: The RNASEQ Toolkit is under heavy development and is not yet stable.

## Vision

The RNASEQ Toolkit:
- Facilitates analysis of gene expression in biological samples
- Reveals differential expression across multiple transcriptomes
- Enables parallel processing of transcriptomic sequences at the scale of personal computing

## Purpose

Since the advent of next-generation RNA sequencing technologies in the first decade of the 21st century, the amount of publicly available transcriptomic data from biomedical research has increased dramatically.  This data has incredible potential to reveal differential gene expressions and therefore potential drug targets.  This toolkit is developed with the particular intention to support cardiac muscle tissue engineering research.

Using these RNASEQ bioinformatics tools, tissue engineering researchers will be able to effectively identify drug targets to increase the maturity of engineered cardiac tissues.  We hope these drug targets will accelerate research in human cardiac therapeutics.
