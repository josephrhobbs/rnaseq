# The RNASEQ Toolkit 

A highly efficient, open-source software tool for next-generation RNA sequencing.

## WIP Notice

The RNASEQ Toolkit is under heavy development and is not yet stable.

## Vision

The RNASEQ Toolkit:
- Facilitates analysis of gene expression in biological samples
- Reveals differential expression across multiple transcriptomes
- Enables parallel processing of transcriptomic sequences at the scale of personal computing

## Licensing

The RNASEQ Toolkit is developed and maintained by Joseph Hobbs and is made open-source under the terms of the __MIT License__.  See `LICENSE` for more information.
